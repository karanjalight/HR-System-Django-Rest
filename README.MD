<h2> Backend </h2>
I started with creating the models for the database tables, 
    I sketched on a book then actualized with code and tested my implementations using  django admin

I created the serializers for my models and connected all the related fields

I proceeded to creating the views for the serialized models


Finally, I created the URLs for Routing into the RESTful APIS to get the JSON data


<h2> Frontend </h2>
After Further research I used Single File Component (SFC) for the ease of abstraction of
 different user information and over another level of security for the application 
The SFC is deployed on a different IP which will be connect to this website backend
